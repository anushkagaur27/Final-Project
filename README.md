# Final-Project - Dog Allergy Detection
Hi my name is Anushka Gaur and my final project was a dog allergy detector. This model 
classifies whether a specific dog is hypoallergenic or not. This model uses a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) 
through the jetson-nano. It also uses resnet-18 and imagenet to train and classify the images.
